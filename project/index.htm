      <dt>Retired Clarkstown Resident Starts Salad Dressing Company
Pop Pop's Best is available so far in Congers, Nyack, Pearl River and New City stores


        </p>
      <dd>When he retired a bit less than two years ago, Lee Licht wasn’t sure if he wanted to kick back and relax. 

Instead, he started a business. 

“I was urged by my family to come out and market a salad dressing that I had been making for them and for my friends for years,” he said. “So, basically, that’s what I did.”

</dd>
      <dt>For the last few years, whenever there was a family gathering or Licht, of New City, was meeting with friends for a meal, he’d be in charge of bringing the salad and, perhaps more importantly, the dressing. 
</dt>
      <dd>“It’s basically a product that I started with on a very simple basis, just a simple balsamic-type salad dressing,” he said. “Through the years I played with it, made it more complex and more complex and more complex, but I finally arrived at a taste that I liked and that everybody else seems to like.”
</dd>
      <dt>Licht continued to tinker and play around with his recipe for years until he settled on a recipe, one that’s still a balsamic dressing, but one with a slight kick or zing. 
</dt>
      <dd>“It started because I wanted to concoct a simple salad dressing,” he said. “From there every batch was just a little different. I kept adding and subtracting ingredients to get it right. “I love to cook. I’m a kitchen guy.”</dd>
      <dt>Licht’s prowess in the kitchen doesn’t end with salad dressing, though. He said some of his other famous recipes within his family include Chicken Kiev and spaghetti sauce. 
</dt>
      <dd>“My wife’s Italian and she likes the spaghetti sauce, or gravy as some call it, so that’s good,” he said. 

But it was his salad dressing that his family urged him to look into marketing. Licht found a company upstate, Nelson Farms, to help produce the dressing. Nelson Farms is also connected to Cornell University, which prepared the nutritional facts for Licht’s dressing.
